# rcfiles
This repository contains various rc files that I've settled on over
the years. It currently just has a vimrc and bashrc. Maybe I'll add
an npmrc if I ever have the need.

## vimrc
my vimrc. use at your own risk.

mostly for clojure development; maybe some python stuff.

## basrc
my bashrc. again, use at your own risk.
